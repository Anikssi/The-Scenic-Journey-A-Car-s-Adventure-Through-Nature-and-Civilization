# The-Scenic-Journey-A-Car-s-Adventure-Through-Nature-and-Civilization
A Computer Graphics Animation using OpenGL (C++ | GLUT | Code::Blocks)

This project showcases an animated journey of a car traveling through four distinct environments — a rural village, a wind turbine field, an ocean road and a bustling city. Developed entirely with OpenGL and GLUT in C++, it demonstrates dynamic animation, smooth scene transitions and environmental storytelling.

🚗 Features:

Real-time animation of a moving car with rotating tires

Dynamic environmental effects — moving clouds, rippling water, rotating wind turbines

Four scenic environments blending nature and civilization

Smooth transitions between scenes using OpenGL transformations

Minimal user input — scenes transition automatically or by keypress

Optimized performance using modular functions and display lists

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Language: C++

Libraries: OpenGL, GLUT

IDE: Code::Blocks

Platform: Windows

🎯 Objective:
To create a cohesive visual experience demonstrating how computer graphics can simulate diverse environments and tell a story through animation.
